# The-Witcher
In this project, I looked at the popular Netflix show, The Witcher and scrapped information on characters from the book series from The Witcher Wiki using Selenium and extracted relationships from books and network analyses using Spacy and NetworkX.
 The analysis showed popularity of characters and which characters  were highly related to each other.
